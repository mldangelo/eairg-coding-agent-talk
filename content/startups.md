Please help me make a comprehensive survey of every venture-funded AI coding startup in 2024 and 2025. We should search up until September 2025. We can look at lists on GitHub, AI awesome stuff examples include not only things like OpenAI Codex, Ananthropic Cloud, and Gemini CLI, but also Cognition, and Windsurf, and Devon, and Klein, and Plandex, many smaller companies too. I want a total survey. If possible, include numbers about fundraising from each company, like how much they raised, when the company started, any important or notable milestones, if open source, GitHub stars, number of employees, and just anything that you think would make a really compelling article. I am also interested in ones that closed, or are closing, or were acquired.

Below is a concise, venture‑funding–focused survey of AI coding startups with material rounds in 2024–2025 (through Sep 24, 2025). I grouped companies by what they sell in practice: agentic IDEs/coding agents, code assistants inside today’s IDEs, and code review/modernization/infra devtools. For each I list the latest known round, when, and quick context. A compact M&A/closures section follows. Citations sit right after each company group.

Scope. I focused on venture‑funded companies whose primary product is code generation/assistance, agentic IDEs, code review or automated refactors, or tightly‑related dev workflow automation. I included high‑signal open‑source projects only when there was a venture round around them.

A. Agentic IDEs and “vibe coding” platforms

G. Takeaways for a compelling article
Two distinct waves. 2024 seeded the space with big Bs and Cs (Augment, Codeium, Windsurf). 2025 saw mega‑rounds and consolidation: Cursor’s $900M C, Cognition’s >$400M and Windsurf acquisition, plus several specialized tools raising Bs (Graphite, Moderne).
Cognition

Cline

Cline

Agentic IDEs vs. assistants. Cursor, Devin, Windsurf, Bolt.new push toward “build the app from a prompt”, while Codeium, Supermaven, Mintlify, Pieces improve everyday developer flow inside familiar tools.

Enterprise readiness signals. Rounds often coincided with claims of ARR or adoption: Cursor’s >$500M ARR, Bolt.new’s $20M→$40M ARR in months, Replit’s $250M raise and Agent 3. Expect procurement‑friendly features: SSO, SOC2, auditability, on‑prem and MCP/CLI tooling.
Cursor

Business Insider
+2

M&A as a moat move. Cognition buying Windsurf looks like a tech+team consolidation to accelerate agent reliability and UX. Google buying Galileo (design‑to‑UI) suggests Big Tech is locking up adjacent modalities needed for end‑to‑end app creation.
The Information
+1

Open‑source gravity. Cline and Continue are open and well‑funded relative to typical OSS devtools, positioning themselves as the “hackable agent layer.”
Qubika

H. What’s missing or ambiguous
Employee counts, GH stars, and revenue change fast. Where founders provided numbers (Cursor, Bolt.new), I included them. Many others don’t disclose.

Smaller geographies likely have additional funded tools; I included the most credible rounds with public sources.

Want this as a spreadsheet?
I can output a clean CSV with columns you care about (company, product, round, date, amount, valuation if reported, founded, open source status, notable milestones, links). Say the word and I’ll generate it now.

Absolutely. I expanded the landscape, added many more companies, and pulled founding dates and credible industry benchmarks where available. I also packaged everything in a working table you can filter or sort.

Factory — “software droids” for engineering work | $15M Series A, Jun 2024; ~$20M total.

M&A and notable status changes
Windsurf: widely reported M&A talks with OpenAI in May 2025 that did not close. Cognition later announced it acquired Windsurf on Sep 8, 2025.

Founding dates (where verified)
Anysphere 2022.

Cognition Nov 2023.

Windsurf product launched Nov 2024.

Continue Jun 2023.

Moderne 2020.

Lovable 2024.

PearAI 2024.

Warp 2020.

(The CSV includes a “Founded” column. I left cells blank where I could not confirm with a quality source.)

Industry benchmarks and reports you can cite
Stack Overflow Developer Survey
2024: 76% of respondents were using or planning to use AI in development. 2025: 84% using or planning; 51% of pros use AI tools daily.

Gartner Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants
GitHub summarises Gartner’s view that by 2028, 90% of enterprise software engineers will use AI code assistants.

GitHub research (Aug 2024) reported the “AI wave” in dev workflows, including test generation and security use cases.

OpsLevel 2025 survey: among companies using AI coding tools, Copilot shows ~88% penetration, with a long tail for Cursor, Claude, and others.

Executive signal: Robinhood CEO said ~50% of new code is AI‑generated and adoption is “close to 100%” internally.

Big‑tech entrants: Google previewed Jules, an agent that fixes code, reflecting the agentic shift.

Notes on scope and quality bar
I prioritized venture‑funded companies with verifiable rounds announced in 2024–2025. I also included a few OSS projects that incorporated as companies and dev‑tools with strong AI coding features where recent funding or adoption is material.

Where there were conflicting reports (for example, Windsurf M&A rumors), I show the timeline and cite both the early rumor and the later, confirmed outcome.

What’s next
If you want, I can:

Enrich the table with employee counts from public profiles and add links per row.

Add GitHub star counts for every OSS entry and snapshot them with dates.

Append a “closed or acquired” tracker for 2024–2025 with sources.

If you prefer, I can also turn the CSV into a clean Google‑Sheets‑style brief with charts of funding by category and quarter.
